    "You are given a problem set by your business analyst demanding that TwoPlus Earbuds X are distributed with a specific mean and standard deviation. Your goal is to calculate how many to manufacture to satisfy customer needs as well as profits. In this assignment, you will work with your group to code a simulation in Python to resolve this dilemma and determine the optimal number of TwoPlus Earbuds Xs to manufacture.\n",

At a minimum, you will need to turn in a digital copy of this document to your instructor as part of your assignment completion. You may also have additional supporting documents that you will need to submit. Your instructor will provide feedback to help you work through your findings.\n",

    "Based on our first test output, we would produce 166 earbuds because that is the quantity at which profit is maximized ($17,340). The number of earbuds increases slightly under this scenario. In a normal distribution, the demand data is more likely to be closer to the mean. The chance of a uniform distribution changes that because it introduces a 50% chance of demand data results that are uniformly distributed, each having an equally likely chance of occurring. "
